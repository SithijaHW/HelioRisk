            Space weather refers to the environmental conditions in space as influenced by solar activity and the 
            solar wind's interaction with Earth's magnetosphere. Unlike terrestrial weather, space weather involves 
            electromagnetic phenomena that can significantly impact technology and human activities.
            
            **Key Components:**
            **Solar Wind**: A stream of charged particles continuously flowing from the Sun
            **Magnetic Fields**: Complex magnetic field interactions between the Sun and Earth
            **Radiation**: High-energy particles and electromagnetic radiation from solar events
            **Plasma Environment**: Ionized gas in space affecting radio wave propagation
            
            Understanding space weather is crucial for protecting our technology-dependent society from 
            potentially catastrophic disruptions.
